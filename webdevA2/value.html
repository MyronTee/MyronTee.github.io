                    <p>We all know luxury watches are very valuable.</p>
                    <p>
                        But why are they so valuable? There are so many brands of luxury watches around
                        but why are a few specific brands such as Rolex so much more expensive?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Are they really worth that price? What makes these watches so special to the point 
                        where its price ranges from anywhere from 10 to 100 times of an average watch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And how do they maintain that price value? How are these watches, though second-hand, 
                        somehow even more expensive than the price in the official store?
                    </p> 
                </div>
            </div>

                    <h1>Why that Value?</h1>
                </div>
                <div class="container-center js-scroll">
                    <p>
                        Many luxury watches such as Patek Philippe are hand crafted with high-quality materials, 
                        and only a small number of them are made annually, making them even more unique.
                        Since these watches are so hard to make, and the supply is way lower than the demand, 
                        this makes the watches seem even rarer than they actually, which will cause
                        the price of them to get marked up even more, resulting in the very expensive prices
                        we have come to know this day.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        Another factor that affects the price of a luxury watch is the reputation of its 
                        brand. Watches from Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet, and other premium brands 
                        will almost always go up in value, never mind holding their own. 
                        The same goes for Rolex, which has built a brand identity that far outpaces any other.

            <p>
                Luxury Watches can be a form of investment since many of them don't
                lose their worth, but not all of them can maintain their value. 
                Therefore before buying a watch, you need to know which ones are really
                worth it to buy.

                    Patek Philippe watches are known to be masterpieces,
                    with standard editions selling for over 10K. One of the 
                    most worth series is their nautilus series. As the most
                    popular series, this line of watches will always maintain its value
                    or is sold for a price higher than retail.

                <p>
                    Rolex is undoubtedly the most popular luxury watch brand around, and has watch
                    prices ranging from 5k to 100k for standard models. However, only their
                    full steel men watches above size 40 can retain any monetary value, with
                    the submariner series being its most popular and valuable series.

                <p>
                    Audemars Piguet is a swiss brand that produces watches of such high 
                    quality that can almost match the resale price of Rolex watches.
                    However, buyers are often expected to spend between 3k to 170k for a watch.
