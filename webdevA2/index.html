                In the modern age, the purpose of wearing a watch is no longer just about being able to tell the time. 
                These days, as well as basic two-hand watches, watches have evolved to feature various sophisticated technologies which make life more convenient.
                And now watches have become so commonplace in modern-day lifestyles that it is not uncommon for people to own several watches, just as they do with clothing outfits.

                Sure, we can just use our smartphones to check the time. 
                But aren't there other reasons why people still use watches? 
                And is the smartphone always the best option?
                So here are some reason why people wear watches.

                <h2><b>For Fashion</b></h2>
                <p>
                    Today, for the vast majority of people who are wearing watches, they wear it as an accessory - a piece of jewelry that enhances their style and appearance.
                    Furthermore, the watch is to a large extent considered to be the only real piece of jewelry that men can wear without risking coming off as feminine.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    And while women have plenty of accessories and pieces of jewelry to choose from, from rings, bracelets, handbags, and much more, but men,
                    generally speaking, of course, struggle more to pull that off, but a watch is an accessory that always works, no matter what.
                </p>
                    A good looking watch can also significantly enhance your appearance, as well as be matched to the outfit you're wearing,
                    and this is, as mentioned, probably the most common reason people wear a watch.

            <div class="functions js-scroll">
                <h2><b>Functionality</b></h2>
                <p>
                    While watches aren't tools that are crucial to us today, they are tremendously functional and offer a number of different helpful functions that can improve your everyday life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the constant rise of new technologies, watches for divers and pilots have also came into existance, along with smartwatches. 
                    Dive watches are made to widstand water depths of several hundred metres, while aviator watches are designed to make readint the time easy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, when it comes to smartwatches, things get far more complicated. Even though smartwatches are much more fragile,
                    it allows users to make calls, text others, track health stats, use google maps, or even game on them. 
                    Greatly increasing the number of functionalities of a watch.

                <img src="images/shock1.jpg" class="shock1" alt="shock resistant watch 1">
                <img src="images/shock2.jpg" class="shock2" alt="shock resistant watch 2">

            <div class="reliable js-scroll">
                <h2><b>Reliability</b></h2>
                <p>
                    With the exception of a smartwatch, typical quartz watches' battries can last around a year,
                    with mechanical watches lasting forever as long as they are winded or used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, many watches are often made shock resistant, be it through rubber padding or stainless steel,
                    making it way harder to break as compared to a smartphone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hence, this makes analog watches much more reliable as they last much longer than other devices such as smartphones, 
                    which has a limited battery life of around a day and is much more fragile.
