                Many Watches contain similar outer parts, 
                each with its respective funtions. 
                So lets take a look at each of them and their respective features
                through the mini assembly game below.

                        <h1>The Brezel</h1>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The Brezel is a metal ring that surrounds the watch crystal. 
                        Often bezels rotate on watches (usually on dive watches) 
                        and contain a scale for time or other measurements. 
                        Some remain stationary or do not have a scale and are purely decorative.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="hands-text">
                    <div class="title">
                        <h1>The Hands</h1>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The Hands are the pointers positioned 
                        in the center of the watch dial and points to
                        the markings on the dial and bezel to tell the time.
                        The hands usually consists of the Hour hand, minute hand, and the second hand.
                        They may also be made luminecent to allow time telling in the dark.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="dial-text">
                    <div class="title">
                        <h1>The Dial</h1>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The Dial, also called the face of the watch, 
                        displays the time and features numerals and markings.
                        The dial also hosts the watch hands, and is often made
                        simple in aviator watches for ease of reading.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-text">
                    <div class="title">
                        <h1>The Case</h1>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The case, which is often made of tough materials such as
                        metal or has protective layers of rubber or plastic, is what
                        holds all the components of the watch together. It is also what
                        protects the watch from all kind of damage during daily use, hence
                        the protective materials and designs for it.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="system-text">
                    <div class="title">
                        <h1>The System</h1>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The System of the watch is the mechanism that keeps the watch running.
                        This can can be either mechanical (automatic or hand-wound) or quartz (battery powered). 
                        Most watch manufacturers refer to their movements as “calibers.” 
                        In a mechanical movement, the main components are a mainspring, a gear train, 
                        an escapement and a balance wheel. In a quartz movement, 
                        the main components are a battery, a microchip circuit, a quartz crystal and a stepper motor.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="crown-text">
                    <div class="title">
                        <h1>The Crown</h1>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The crown is a small knob on the side of the watch case 
                        that can be used to adjust the time, date and wind the watch to keep it running.
                        The crown can also be used to configure additional components of a watch face like the world clocks or a lunar calendar.
                        Furthermore, on a divers' watch, 
                        the crown screws down with a water-resistant seal to assist in keeping moisture out of the watch's internal mechanisms.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="caseback-text">
                    <div class="title">
                        <h1>The Case Back</h1>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The Case Back is, as its name suggests, 
                        the reverse side of a watch case that can be removed to access the inside of the watch.
                        Many case backs are made with a clear area or is made fully clear for aesthetic purposes,
                        such as to display the mechanism inside.
