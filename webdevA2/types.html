                When classified based on their anatomy,
                there are 6 different types of watches. 
                The watch anatomy will then decide how the watch 
                functions and its battery lifespan.

                When you sit down and really consider a watch, 
                you'll quickly see that there are many fine details to take into consideration. 
                There are dozens of different potential details to think about, 
                and a dizzying array of combinations are available. 
                By learning about each separate part of a watch, 
                you can decide precisely what you're after. 
                This will make your search more streamlined and much simpler.

                        Quartz watches are one of the most commonly found watches these day
                        as the quartz movement is both reliable and affordable.

                <h3>How a Quartz Watch works</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    For a quartz watch, a battery-powered current will move through a quartz crystal, 
                    making it oscillate incredibly fast. 
                    This oscillation will then power a motor that moves the hands of the watch.
                    However, the downside to quartz watches is that they require an occasional battery replacement 
                    (usually 2 - 3 years depending on the make and model).

                    <p>
                        Automatic and Kinetic watches both features a self-winding design, which means that the watch will 
                        keep running as long as its worn regularly. Mechanical watches on the other hand will need to be manually wound up
                        regularly to keep running.

                <h3>More About Wound-Up Watches</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Watches that have Wound-Up movement are generally very accurate, 
                    as long as they are worn on a regular basis. 
                    Although, in general, they simply are not as accurate as quartz watches 
                    and should not be expected to keep time to the same degree of accuracy.
                    However, it should be noted that an automatic watch can keep running longer than 
                    a kinetic or mechanical watch as it still has a rechargable inside while the other two don't.

                        Both Ecodrive and Tough Solar Watches are known for their capability to 
                        keep itself running using solar power. This is because they both have small
                        solar panels on the watch face which is used to charge the watch's battery.

                <hr>
                <p>
                    These Watches are eco-friendly. Like really really eco-friendly.
                    This is because they don't ever need battery changes and with just
                    a one time charging with solar power, the battery can already last for
                    around 6 months. This also makes it a very reliable watch.
